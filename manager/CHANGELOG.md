# Changelog

Terse by design: one line per change, newest first. The narrative behind each
entry (root causes, measurements, alternatives considered) lives in git
history — `git log -p -- manager/CHANGELOG.md` before 2026-09-08 — and in the
commit messages.

## 2026-09-08
- Memory as files: `mgr/memfs.py` keeps one Markdown folder per instance (notes, daily timeline coarsened to weekly, git-committed), mounted read-write at `/memory`; the agent gets its index every turn
- Harness disk: the agent code (`AGENT_SRC`) rides a read-only 8 MB ext4 drive rebuilt on content change, so an agent fix is one instance restart instead of a rootfs build; stale badge counts it
- Secrets: a release lets the hub substitute on the host, only keys in `guest_readable` reach a VM raw (Secrets tab column); existing installs are seeded from their releases once
- Guest DNS comes from `site.json` via the config disk (`GUEST_DNS`), no address in the image; one `mkfs_image` helper for config, upper and harness drives
- if-chain gone: every HTTP path is a registered route, `_do_GET`/`_do_POST` dispatch only; 104 routes, test guards the chain stays empty
- Route handlers share `_body`/`_json`/`_guest` helpers and one error decorator; unknown API paths answer 404 instead of the admin page
- Architecture tab: client row reordered (Desktop client first), iroh/Traefik arrows re-routed; README screenshot regenerated
- Git history rewritten (git-filter-repo): phone numbers, LAN prefix, private host, `mcp-catalog.json`, author e-mails scrubbed
- GitHub is `origin` with full history; `push-github.sh` squash publisher removed; Gitea kept as private archive remote `gitea`
- Agent appends playbooks, recall notes and missions right before the current message instead of at the top of the context
- voicecommand "Uhr" playbook rewritten as a positive rule with examples — the negative wording was ignored by the model
- caldav-mcp: `patch-caldav.js` normalizes `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM zone` and bare dates into ISO with offset for `start`/`end`/`due`/`until`
- `[Now]` line names the UTC offset and the exact tool-input datetime form; voicecommand playbook: default calendar, 1 h default, never ask
- `ha_control`: area name + group cue ("licht", "alle") beats a good fuzzy hit (≥0.9 still wins) — relay was switched instead of lights
- `ha_control`: `learn_alias` no longer crashes on a `None` alias in HA's registry
- `/api/tts` filters every text with `speakable_text()` (tool lines, think blocks, code, URLs) — Read aloud spoke "🔧 ha_control …"

## 2026-09-07
- `espclient/` (MrVoice, push-to-talk ESP32-S3 client, ESP-IDF/PlatformIO) joins the monorepo; credentials via NVS/`config_local.h`
- Architecture tab gains an "ESP32 client (MrVoice)" card
- Voice turns via `/api/chat/<inst>` mirrored into the shared chat store as `Voice · <inst> · <time>` (`voice_session()`); `/reset` archives
- `/api/stt-recent/audio?i=N` (admin) returns the N-th most recent STT upload (last 5, memory only) — diagnosed the ESP32's flat-line mic
- `[Now]` line moved from context top to right before the current message with "earlier times are outdated" — gemini-flash reused stale times
- `GET /api/stt-recent` (admin): last 50 STT transcripts with time, seconds and caller, memory only
- Hub processes get `TZ` = host zone via `mgr/mcp.py: hub_env()` (catalog may override) — ts-caldav parsed Berlin times as UTC
- caldav patches moved to `mcp-hub/patch-caldav.js`; `list-events` returns `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM <zone>`, whole-day events as plain dates
- `[Now]` line tells the model to convert `…Z` timestamps before stating a time; known limit: recurring events report master DTSTART
- mcp-hub image patches caldav-mcp `list-calendars` to absolute URLs against `CALDAV_BASE_URL` — relative hrefs broke `list-events`
- Agent injects one `[Now]` system line per turn (weekday, date, time, zone); manager writes `TZ` (`GUEST_TZ` override) into every config disk
- `--smoke` and the live test wait up to 120 s for the agent bridge before asking `/tools`
- Policy tab: MCP servers of an existing instance as checkboxes; Save MCP writes `MCP_SERVERS` via the config route, offers Restart now
- Each MCP server shows its `${SECRET}` placeholders as released/unreleased; route refuses names not in the catalog (`mcp_servers_error()`)
- Stale-image detection: `image_state()` compares VM start with image build time; `/api/instances` carries `stale`, tab shows "old image"
- New `restart` action (stop + start) and "Restart on new image" button; idle worker `image_sweep()` pushes once per rebuild
- `build-openrouter-rootfs.sh --smoke <instance>` restarts that instance after the build and runs the model-free `/tools` registry test
- Agent `_resolve_tool_name()` accepts a bare MCP tool name when it matches exactly one registered tool — model dropped the `server__` prefix
- New `/tools` command lists the registry as the model sees it, without a model call
- `LiveAgent.test_tools_registry_after_rebuild` smoke-tests `/tools` on every instance started after the current rootfs build
- `spawn_subagent(task, model=)` rebuilt on `create_task(target=ephemeral, wait=true)` — the old `/i/<name>/` path had 403'd since 08-14
- `create_task` and `/api/task` accept `model`; carried into `_run_ephemeral` (`OPENROUTER_MODEL`) for waited and queued runs

## 2026-09-06
- Architecture tab: "Fedora voice client" renamed "Desktop client" (text only)
- `resolve_task_target()` strips a leading `@` and refuses unknown names at task create/edit — MSFT task silently failed on `@orchestrator`
- Worker pushes "Scheduled task failed: <id>" once per distinct failure text; hourly `task_target_sweep()` pushes "Task target unknown" once
- Tasks editor can move a task to another instance (`update_task(..., instance=)`); MSFT task retargeted and reworded to fetch, not schedule
- Web UI dead: a `'\n'` Python escape in `mgr/ui_js.py` broke the whole client script; fixed to `'\\n'`
- `tests/check_js.py` + `run-tests.sh` step 0d run `node --check` on the rendered client script (host node or the mcp-hub container)
- Plugins tab: file names deep-link into code-server (`site.json` key `CODE_ROOT`); in-manager viewer and `/api/plugins/<name>/file` removed
- code-server container needs the live manager tree mounted (command in `manager/README.md`)
- Missions tab: Edit (goal, steps by position, status incl. reopen) and Delete for any status via `/api/mission-admin`; all finished listed
- Plugins tab: read-only source viewer `GET /api/plugins/<name>/file` (admin, path-confined, 512 KB) so approval is not blind (superseded)
- Guest GET denylist `guest_get_blocked`: `/`, `/chat`, `/katfs…`, `/i/<name>/…` — a VM could open every other VM's terminal
- `/api/task` target policy `guest_may_target`: self or `ephemeral` only, others via `DELEGATE_TARGETS` (comma list, `*`); orchestrator keeps all
- `/api/agents`, `/api/history`, `/api/hitl/<id>` scoped per guest; `/api/inbox` orchestrator-only among guests
- Host firewall: `ensure_guest_input_rules()` limits guest→host to :8700 and :2049; `ensure_antispoof()` per tap drops foreign source IPs
- `_auth` exempts guests (source IP + allow/deny lists) — a set `MANAGER_PASS` would have locked every agent out
- CalDAV as MCP server: `caldav-mcp` (11 tools, events + VTODO) installed in the `mcp-hub` image; catalog entry `caldav` configured by env
- `CALDAV_PASSWORD` as `${CALDAV_PASSWORD}` from the host secret store; released for `myassistant`/`voicecommand`; values still placeholders

## 2026-09-04
- Architecture SVG: Halo glasses (off the app) and Fedora/Linux voice client added; `iroh-gw` beside Traefik; two new component cards
- `voicecommand` instance got its secret releases (HA/mrmusic/portainer) — Home Assistant had loaded 0 tools
- New agent tool `ha_control(spoken, action)`: deterministic matching in the manager (exact → strong fuzzy → area + group cue → weak fuzzy)
- `ha_control` auto-learns the spoken phrase as an HA alias on fuzzy hits; HA token never leaves the host
- `mgr/haalias.py` (HA WebSocket registry + REST), guest routes `/api/ha-alias` + `/api/ha-control`; "Gartenhaus" HA area created
- Voice client: `"prompt"` config / `--prompt` prepends a `[Voice-Client] …` frame to every spoken message (default: short, speakable)
- Voice client speaks sentence-streamed (splitter on the token stream, think/code held); `--headless` prints stage timings
- mrmusic MCP registered (`mcp-remote` → `https://mrmusic.kat56.de/mcp`, `${MRMUSIC_TOKEN}` host-side); released for myassistant, 7 tools

## 2026-09-03
- Heartbeat skip reschedule was never saved → same heartbeat re-skipped every 5 s; `worker_claim()` now has an explicit dirty contract
- Voice client local wake word (`"wake_mode": "local"`): `--enroll` records MFCC templates, subsequence DTW gate, pure Go; `--wake-test`
- On a local wake hit the word is cut from the audio and only the remainder goes to STT — so "Kaim" works despite STT mangling
- Wake-word fixes: channel mean in the model, enrollment takes trimmed to voiced core, distance uses c1..c12
- Wake word takes a comma-list of variants (default `"Kati, Katharina"`), Levenshtein 1 for 4+ letters; tray shows dropped utterances as ✕
- Voice client and tunnel are one binary: release build embeds `kaim56-tunnel` via `go:embed`, materialized under `~/.cache/kaim56-voice/`
- Voice client `"iroh": "<node-id>"` config: client spawns `kaim56-tunnel` itself (Pdeathsig), no `base_url`/`user`/`pass` needed
- Voice client refuses a config still carrying the `manager.example` placeholder at startup
- Voice client `"wake_word"` (default `"Kat"`): only transcripts starting with the word reach the agent; word alone answers "Ja?"
- New `kaim56-tunnel` (third binary in `iroh-gw` crate): 127.0.0.1:8701 listener splices TCP onto iroh streams; `--id` prints the NodeId

## 2026-09-02
- Voice client rewritten in Go: one static binary, tray via `fyne.io/systray`, same config file and VAD; `--probe "text"` runs the whole chain
- `run-tests.sh` step 0c runs `go vet` + `go test` (skipped without a Go toolchain)
- `voice-client/`: single-file Python tray client (GNOME/KDE), energy VAD, `/api/stt` → `/api/chat/<inst>` → `/api/tts`; mic muted meanwhile
- VAD noise floor learns only from unvoiced frames — loud speech dragged the threshold past its own RMS
- Agent prompt: store the essence of attached documents in the same turn; "where knowledge goes" rule (memory/playbook/skill/recall_tasks)
- Memory writes support deletion (`value: null`); e2e memory test cleans up; saddler ignores `e2e-*` instances
- Saddler reports usage and cost per instance (both windows, from `llm_usage`)
- Idle heartbeats no longer wake the model: worker reschedules the scheduled heartbeat when inbox is empty and no mission is active
- RMW races closed: gateway toggle via `with_gateway()`, one lock across both `chats.json` cycles; dead second lock in gateway.py removed
- Four more GET routes in the routing table (prompts, resources, iroh status, voice-health): 17 enumerable
- `mgr/ui.py` split into css / html (`ARCH_SVG` its own constant) / js, assembled to a byte-identical `PAGE`
- katfs web client published as a standalone site at `https://uneidel.github.io/katfs-web/`; page reads `?key=`/`#` client-side
- Python review (`python-code-quality`, `python-security-audit`): 14 of 56 silent excepts now log where silence hid damage
- `/api/browse` bounded to `BROWSE_ROOTS` (default /home, /srv, /mnt, /media; site.json override) — it enumerated the whole filesystem as root
- `configure()` injection contracts typed across all mgr modules
- ruff (pyflakes rules) is step 0b of `run-tests.sh`, optional; first run found 10 issues, all fixed
- wdm0006/python-skills (MIT): 31 skills imported into `.claude/skills/` as dev skills, prefixed `python-`/`rust-`; agent catalog back to 67
- Task store RMW race closed: `with_tasks(mutator)` is the only way to change the store; all ten call sites converted; five-thread test
- `tests/check_names.py` (undefined-name gate, stdlib AST) is step 0 of `run-tests.sh` and a pre-commit hook
- Gate found four dormant defects: `save_gateway` import, `base64` in `mgr/gateway.py`, both secret functions never injected in `mgr/mcp.py`
- Task creation was broken for 13 days (missing `uuid` import in `store.py` since the mgr/ split); `test_add_task_roundtrip` added
- Notify route audits the failure reason (`empty` / `rate limit`) — 38 "failures" were the e2e suite; Activity badge says `failed`
- Activity panel shows error text under failed calls and a result peek for healthy ones
- Audit records tool calls AFTER execution: real `ok`, error text, result excerpt, per-turn id (additive fields)
- `mgr/saddler.py` + `GET /api/saddler`: weekly failure digest grouped by error shape, this week vs last; orchestrator-only among guests
- Weekly scheduled task hands the digest to the orchestrator to diagnose and propose playbook lines; patches stay a human decision

## 2026-09-01
- Claude guest: `kaim56_mcp.py` stdio MCP server exposes memory_store/recall, `web_search`, `list_skills`, `load_skill`, `notify` as tools
- `/branch` renamed `/aside` across agent, web chat, app (v5.32) and Claude bridge; `/branch` stays a silent alias
- Claude guest-init writes a "kAIm56 platform" section (memory, websearch, skills, notify recipes) into the workspace `CLAUDE.md`
- Test fixture: `known` backend set includes `claude`
- Claude web bridge intercepts platform slashes: `/fresh`, `/model sonnet|opus|haiku|<id>|default`; other built-ins answer "OpenRouter only"
- Web chat branch button is an in-house inline SVG (no proprietary icon); app v5.31 slash picker adds `/fresh`, `/branch`, `/back`
- System prompt states where tools execute (the agent's own microVM, not the provider) and to retry instead of concluding "blocked"
- `http_fetch` sends a browser user agent plus Accept-Language — portals 403 obvious bot agents
- `memory_recall` URL-quotes the key, manager URL-decodes path segments, slashes stay in the key — a key with a space could never be recalled
- `http_fetch` converts HTML to readable text with link targets in brackets; `raw=true` keeps the body; read cap 5 MB
- Tool schemas: `web_search` says Brave-backed, `http_fetch` documents text conversion and `raw`
- `GET /api/websearch` + `mgr/websearch.py`: search served by the manager; Brave (`BRAVE_API_KEY`) → DDG HTML (ads filtered) → Bing
- `web_search` multi-backend: DDG bot challenge detected and named, Bing fallback; a dead backend is a spoken error, not "no results"
- `_pdf_text` falls back to `pdftotext` in the `kaim56-pdftotext` container (alpine + poppler) before the built-in extractor
- Web chat paperclip takes PDF/DOCX/ODT/text via `/api/extract`; chip previews the extracted text; images keep the vision path
- App v5.30: document chip expands on tap to preview the extracted text
- App v5.29: document attachments (PDF, DOCX, ODT, TXT/MD/CSV/HTML) via admin `POST /api/extract`; `mgr/extract.py` stdlib-only, honest errors
- POST dispatcher consults the routing table first; `/api/extract` is the first table-registered POST route
- Agent strips images from history and retries when the provider rejects an image — every `myassistant` turn had died, nothing ever stored

## 2026-08-31
- Mission advance push collects completions per owner for `MISSION_COLLECT_SECS` (8 s) into one message — each push is a full `/fresh` turn
- `list_skills` returns names only (~250 tokens); `list_skills(query=…)` searches; `GET /api/skills?meta=1` serves metadata without bodies
- Type-aware offload previews: JSON outline, logs with duplicates folded and error lines kept, text head slice; `re` import added to the agent
- `mgr/routes.py` router: exact paths beat prefixes, longest prefix first; first route group migrated Strangler-style
- Route access is a route property (`@ROUTER.get(..., admin=True)`); `Router.inventory()` enumerates the surface
- Test extracts route literals from both dispatchers and fails when a prefix branch shadows an exact one
- `docs/index.html`: static landing page (isolation SVG, features, security, FAQ), no build step
- Fresh UI screenshots via DevTools protocol with instance names and spend blurred from browser-reported rectangles
- Last German UI strings translated (usage line, missions tab, mission log)

## 2026-08-30
- `tools/halo/emu_test.py`: unmodified `katagent.lua` runs on Brilliant Labs' Halo emulator; nine checks incl. the `01 00 00` packet ack
- Device Lua must be pure ASCII (runtime reads latin-1); display measured at 59 columns × 13 lines → defaults 56 × 12; app v5.28
- App v5.27 `VoiceCommand.kt`: "Photo"/"screenshot"/"stop" handled locally at utterance start; question after the command survives
- Photo by voice end to end: glasses camera → JPEG into the chat → reply on the display (`Halo.PhotoCollector`, `HaloBle.awaitPhoto()`)
- Phone screenshot recognised but not wired (needs MediaProjection or accessibility service)
- App v5.26 `HaloController.kt`: connect, upload Lua modules, click → recording → `/api/stt` → instance → reply with line wrapping
- `HaloDryLink` fakes the glasses for tests and a "Dry run" button; Settings gained a "Glasses (Halo)" section
- `HaloBle.kt`: filtered scan, MTU 517, notifications, writes paced by GATT + app-level acks; `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`/`CONNECT` permissions
- Ack check was written against the wire form while the receive side strips `0x01` — every write would have timed out; fixed
- `assets/halo/katagent.lua`: glasses-side app on the unmodified SDK modules (BSD-3-Clause); `tools/halo/test_frame_app.lua` fakes `frame`
- Stop handler no longer clears `streaming` early — it swallowed the final audio chunk `0x06`
- `Halo.kt` aligned with the SDK `plain_text` layout and message codes; ack constants and photo chunk flags added

## 2026-08-29
- `Halo.kt`: BLE protocol of the Brilliant Labs glasses ported to Kotlin (GATT, packet framing, audio chunks, WAV header); no Android deps
- Bluetooth behind the `HaloLink` interface; 15 JVM unit tests (`gradle testDebugUnitTest`); BLE implementation, Lua app and UI still to come

## 2026-08-27
- 55 skills from github.com/daedalus/skills imported (67 total); no upstream license → `skills.json` gitignored, originals in `examples/`
- Skill bodies no longer inlined in the page; editor fetches `GET /api/skills/<name>` on demand (page ~195 KB instead of ~870 KB)
- VS Code link in the footer from `CODE_URL` in gitignored `site.json` (link, not embed — mixed content)
- Missions no longer orchestrator-only: any persistent agent owns its own via `/api/missions` and `/api/mission-start|update|finish`
- `mission_update` gained `target` (executing instance), stored on the step, in the log and shown in UI/app
- Advance trigger pushes to the mission owner instead of `ORCH_INSTANCE`; admin actions resolve the owner by id (`mission_owner(mid)`)
- App v5.25: Missions screen loads all owners, shows owner and executing agent per step

## 2026-08-26
- App v5.24: non-2xx error bodies shown as one clean line (`⚠️ HTTP 503: …`) instead of raw HTML streamed into the bubble
- Manager `/i/<inst>/api/…` answers plain text 503 when the instance is not running; browser path keeps HTML

## 2026-08-24
- App reaches the manager over iroh (P2P, NAT-traversed, e2e encrypted): Rust gateway `iroh-gw` (ALPN `kaim56-mgr/0`) relays to :8700
- Auth = phone node-id allowlist re-read per connection; `mgr/irohgw.py` + `/api/iroh`, Sharing-tab card, `iroh-gw.service`, installer builds it
- App native module `app/iroh-android` (Rust + UniFFI); `IrohUrlConnection` speaks HTTP/1.1 over an iroh stream; base URL `iroh://<node-id>`

## 2026-08-22
- Full German→English pass: comments, docstrings, user-facing strings across manager, chat, agent, app, services, bridges, katfs, scripts, docs
- Prompt-block tags now English (`[Missions]`, `[Summary]`, `[Memory]`, `[Branch]`, `[Sidenote]`); personas renamed `assistant`/`translator`
- Kept as input-tolerance literals: Signal HITL `ja/nein`, `/steps unbegrenzt`, `/reasoning aus`, `/back verwerfen`, Indeed.de date words

## 2026-08-20
- New Resources tab: per-instance vCPU/RAM plus live RSS, CPU% and overlay-disk size (`/api/resources`)
- App v5.19: photo thumbnails in the bubble (Msg `image` field); on-device crash log under Settings › Diagnose
- Security gateway Layer A: scrubber also removes Unicode noncharacters and reserved default-ignorables; `text_unicode.py` now tracked
- Tool-plugin integrity: SHA-256 pinning; Plugins tab flags "changed since approve" with an Approve button; pins in `manager/plugins/.pins.json`
- Policy tab: auto-refresh no longer wipes unsaved tool-checkbox edits; Save shows real errors
- Chat sync (web + app v5.18): diverged histories adopt the newer, not-shorter server state instead of stalling forever
- App v5.17: basic Markdown in assistant messages; v5.16: streamed reply keyed by stable message key (landed in the user bubble before)
- App v5.15: read-timeout back to 600 s, mic interrupt cancels via disconnect handle — "Socket is closed" when first token took >2 s
- App v5.14/v5.13: "Assist button opens instance" setting, as a dropdown of live instances
- App v5.12: silence hang 2.2→3.5 s; tapping the mic during a reply cancels the turn and starts a fresh recording
- Tool plugins support multi-file folders; Plugins tab with drag-and-drop .py/.zip (zip-slip guarded, 5 MB cap), boilerplate, list/delete
- Web chat: Copy button on own messages; bubble text stays selectable through redraws
- New plugin `indeed_filter` (adapted from gvfullstack/JobSearchAutomation): post-filters job lists to new postings; wired into jobresearcher
- Unhandled route exceptions return HTTP 500 with a traceback instead of dropping the connection
- `playbook_add` crashed with RemoteDisconnected: `mgr/rules.py` used `uuid`/`time` without importing them
- Slash typeahead: Esc closes reliably; lists all 8 agent commands (`/fresh`, `/branch`, `/back` added), command-palette styling
- llama.cpp invalid tool-call JSON (HTTP 500): agent retries the turn once without tools
- Chat delete-tombstones sync App↔Web (app v5.11): `{id: deletedAt}` markers via `/api/chats`, 60-day TTL, `chats_tombstones.json`
- Multi-device web chat sync: awaits the server pull before selecting a conversation; open chat repaints on merge
- `_(empty reply)_` with llama.cpp/Qwen3: `reasoning_content` streams as thinking too; reasoning-only turn shows the reasoning
- Web slash typeahead fixed (undefined `escT` threw on render); `/steps` takes any count, `/steps unlimited` (0)
- Agent streams a visible tool-status (🔧) and heartbeat (`HEARTBEAT_SEC=30`) during tool execution — Traefik 180 s idle cut the stream
- Site-specific values externalised into gitignored `site.json` + `mcp-catalog.json`; source uses neutral placeholders
- Leak-filter masks HuggingFace tokens (hf_…); phone-number defaults scrubbed from templates
- Changelog and Architecture moved to a footer row — the topbar overflowed and hid them
- Guardrails at the key-injection proxy: daily token budget (`BUDGET_TOKENS`, 2M) + rate cap (`LLM_RATE_MIN`, 60/min) → 429 + notify
- Worker task-frequency cap: >6 runs/h of the same task → suspended 1 h + notify
- `EGRESS_ALLOW` per instance (domains/IPs resolved at start) via an iptables FC chain
- Leak-filter on notify/send_signal for known key patterns (sk-or-/sk-ant-/ptr_/gh*_/AKIA/xox*/JWT); git SHAs untouched
- Worker bugs from the refactoring: `chat_log_append` back in manager.py (NameError), `import re` in `mgr/store.py` (scheduled tasks looped)
- Worker hardened: each post-run step guarded, runtime orphan watch (>30 min running → requeue), diagnostic `run/worker.log`
- Notification click opens the real chat (app 5.10 + web); bell "Clear" removes notifications; slim theme scrollbars
- App 5.9: errors expire after 8 s, hints after 4 s; AGPL/SPDX header in all Kotlin sources
- `TASKS_FILE` undefined after the mgr/ split → `/api/tasks` crashed, worker died; fixed in `store.configure()` + `reclaim_stuck_tasks()`

## 2026-08-19
- Strangler-Fig refactoring done: manager.py 6,705 → ~1,400 lines core; nine `mgr/` modules (ui, store, signal, missions, notify, rules, …)
- mgr modules never import manager; cross-references via `configure()`/injection; install.sh copies `mgr/`
- Tree chat: `/branch [topic]` opens a nestable side branch, `/back` condenses it to one `[side note]` line (`/back drop` discards)
- Key-injection gateway active: agents call `/api/llm/<backend>/chat/completions`, manager injects Authorization; toggle `LLM_KEY_PROXY`
- New `oracle` tool: second opinion without tools before risky actions (`ORACLE_MODEL`); playbook forces it before `delete_task`
- Playbooks panel in the Personas tab (view/add/remove per agent)
- Installer verified end to end on a QEMU rig with nested KVM: a Firecracker microVM booted inside the test VM; smoke test accepts 401 as alive
- "Thinking" details no longer pops open on every streamed token — open/closed state preserved across repaint
- `/steps [n]` changes max tool steps at runtime; `AGENT_MAX_STEPS` permanent; jobresearcher set to 30
- New admin route `POST /api/instances/<n>/config {key,value}` sets/deletes a single config value (secrets excluded)
- `/model` switches model/backend mid-session without restart, context preserved
- Steering: a message during a running turn is injected as `[steering]` between tool steps; app 5.8; guest `POST /api/steer`
- Prompt templates as slash commands (Personas tab, `prompts.json`, `GET/POST /api/prompts`); expansion in the agent → Web, App and Signal
- Tool plugins: one .py per tool in `firecracker/plugins/` (DESC/PARAMS/REQUIRED + run()), loaded from `/config/plugins`; collisions rejected
- pi/prime templates decommissioned (never used; ~7 GB rootfs freed); source stays in git history
- `install.sh` (curl | sh): preflight, layout, Firecracker v1.16.1, kernel via `VMLINUX_URL`, rootfs/embed/mcp-hub builds, systemd unit
- Portability: `GUEST_DNS`, `CLAUDE_CRED_SRC`, `AGENT_DIR`, `FC_DIR` via env; embed/, mcp-hub/, tests/, run-tests.sh checked in
- Mission tools and `offload_read` added to `AGENT_TOOLS_CATALOG`; drift test keeps agent BUILTIN and manager catalog congruent
- Browser terminal died after ~10 s idle: connect timeout stayed as read timeout; set to None after connect plus TCP keepalive
- Overlay boot added to pi/prime/claude guest inits; `OVERLAY_ROOTFS` covers all four images
- Overlay rootfs: ro base + per-instance rw upper via overlayfs + pivot_root; no more 2 GB copy per start; degraded ro fallback
- Persistent disk per instance (default off): upper survives stop/start; `/api/instances/<n>/persist` + `/diskreset`; upper mounted `-o sync`
- Voice section in Settings: status via `GET /api/voice-health`, TTS voice and speed; service `/tts` takes `voice` + `speed`; two new voices
- Manager mixes voice/speed from settings into the `/api/tts` body — no client update needed
- Missions get their own tab (web) and screen (app 5.7); notifications carry a `link` (missions | tasks | chat:<instance>) and open the target
- Missions: `mission_start/missions/mission_update/mission_finish` (orchestrator, TASK_ADMIN), `missions.json`, survives /reset and VM restart
- Mission advance fires directly when a waited task finishes (`_mission_advance_fire`); caps 5 active / 20 steps; 7-day TTL sweep
- Missions panel in the Tasks tab and app 5.6; routes `/api/missions`, `/api/mission-*`, `/api/mission-admin`
- Chat UI (/chat) pulled onto the Industry design system (blueprint corners, Barlow Condensed, token ramps, dark mode)
- Chrome "Save password?" popup on chat switch: API-key fields were `type=password`; masked via CSS `-webkit-text-security` instead
- Model dropdown jumped back: async race in `loadModels` read the value at fetch start, now on resolve; manager page `Cache-Control: no-store`
- Model dialog knows `ORCAROUTER_MODEL` and `LLAMA_MODEL`
- Activity dialog: time filter (1h/24h/7d/All) and usage total via `GET /api/usage/<name>?since=` (`usage_for`)
- App 5.5 VAD: floor as minimum over ~0.6 s, absolute margin, hysteresis — recording cut off mid-speech after ~4 s; `VAD_HANG` 2200 ms
- Notifications: agent tool `notify(title, message)` → `POST /api/notify`; `notifications.json` with long-poll; web bell; app 5.4

## 2026-08-18
- Harness pattern (strands-agents/harness-sdk, ported): `_trim_history` summarizes the oldest messages into a `[summary]` block
- Context offloader: tool outputs > `OFFLOAD_MIN` go to `.offload/`, preview + reference stay; new tool `offload_read(id, offset)`
- `/goal <criterion>`: a judge checks the answer, up to `GOAL_MAX_ATTEMPTS`=3; app 5.2 picker
- Tool hook: hard denylist (rm -rf /, fork bomb, mkfs) always on; optional HITL approval via Signal (`HITL=1`, `HITL_TOOLS`, `/api/hitl`)
- Retry with backoff around every model call (429/5xx); empty tools list no longer sent (400 at summarizer/judge)
- E2E test suite `tests/e2e.py` / `./run-tests.sh`: OFFLINE, HTTP and LIVE tiers, stdlib unittest; runs with every change
- `/api/agents` reports all MODEL_KEYS plus a real `backend` field; agent knows its backend/model from the system prompt
- `set_model("orcarouter:tencent/hy3")` sets backend and model; orchestrator moved to OrcaRouter `tencent/hy3`
- OrcaRouter as second LLM backend: template `orcarouter.json`, `ORCAROUTER_API_KEY`/`ORCAROUTER_URL`/`ORCAROUTER_MODEL`
- Playbooks: fixed rules the orchestrator learns (`playbook_add`/`playbooks`/`playbook_forget`, `playbooks.json`, cap 40), always in the prompt
- `/reasoning [low|medium|high|off]` toggles OpenRouter reasoning; thinking streamed separately and shown as an expandable block
- `list_tasks`/`delete_task`/`edit_task` for the orchestrator only via injected `TASK_ADMIN` flag (menu and route gated)
- Signal receiving: gateway switched to `json-rpc`, stdlib WebSocket receiver; new message triggers the orchestrator immediately
- katfs file browser in the Sharing tab: share selector, "Download all" as ZIP (`/api/katfs/zip`, cap 2000 files / 512 MB); `katfs-share` CLI
- App 4.9–5.1: selectable bubble text, slash-command picker, thinking display
- MSFT task repaired with a fixed Yahoo URL and `http_fetch` instruction

## 2026-08-17
- Orchestrator token runaway (249M tokens): heartbeat `every 1m` → `every 30m`; heartbeats run stateless with `/fresh` in a throwaway context
- Sliding context cap `CTX_MAX_MSGS=20`, cut only at clean turn boundaries
- Memory instruction defused: no unprompted lectures about memory mechanics; durable facts quietly via `memory_store`

## 2026-08-16
- Semantic long-term memory: `memory_store` embeds notes (multilingual-e5 on CPU, new `embed` container :8772) into `history.db`
- Per turn the manager returns the semantically nearest notes as a `[memory]` block (`sem_store`/`sem_search`, `POST /api/memory-search`)
- App 4.8 passes unknown slash commands through to the agent (keeps `/task`, `/agents`, `/help`); `/reset` retrofitted into the claude web bridge
- Behavior guardrails from Anthropic's published system prompts in the OpenRouter/llama base prompt (no hallucination, tools first, tone)
- Self-hosted LLM via llama.cpp: settings `LLAMA_ENDPOINT` + `LLAMA_API_KEY`, template `llama`, `LLAMA_MODEL`; LAN target opened in FORWARD

## 2026-08-15
- claudy: guest route `GET /api/claude-credentials` delivers the live `claudeAiOauth` block at boot (claude template only, by source IP)
- Manager proxy unpacks JSON `{"reply": …}` from the claude bridge into text/plain for the app
- Per-instance FORWARD chain: assigned MCP endpoints + guest DNS ACCEPT, private networks REJECT, internet ACCEPT — VMs could reach the LAN
- MCP hub (`mcp-hub/`, 127.0.0.1:8771): MCP processes run once per (instance, server) on the host; guests speak JSON-RPC via `POST /api/mcp`
- Secrets injected host-side; `/api/mcp-config` delivers placeholders only; every `tools/call` audited; `mcp-portainer` removed from the image
- New Architecture tab: theme-aware SVG plus 15 component cards; `<style>` inside inline SVG and unquoted attributes were the traps
- Standing memory instruction in every system prompt; agent injects remembered facts on the first turn after restart
- ext4 journal incident: all instances of a template shared one writable rootfs; each VM now gets its own fresh copy at start
- Model chip is a button: `POST /api/instances/<n>/model` + `set_model()`, effective after stop/start
- New tool `send_signal`: sending via manager `/api/signal`; recipients must be in `ALLOWED_SENDERS`; 10 per 5 min; `SIGNAL_API` setting
- Security gateway per chat (`gateway.json`, shield icon): strips invisible Unicode both ways and EXIF/XMP/C2PA from uploads (`text_unicode.py`)
- KatAgent 4.3–4.7: speech-pause detection, tap to stop output, gateway toggle, version in drawer, digital-assistant registration
- KatAgent 4.2: microphone button (AAC/M4A 16 kHz) → `ManagerSync.stt()`, hands-free submit; speaker per reply; voice-asked replies read aloud
- Voice service (`voice/`): Parakeet TDT v3 STT, Piper TTS (Thorsten), ffmpeg; routes `/api/stt` and `/api/tts`; web microphone + Read aloud

## 2026-08-14
- Critical: POST routes were open to guests — a VM could `POST /api/instances/<n>/mounts` and NFS-mount `/` writable; guest POST allowlist
- Stored XSS fixed: `h()` (html.escape) on model id, description, mount paths and tool list in the admin page
- Open: `MANAGER_PASS` empty → `_auth()` lets everyone through; protection rests on Traefik
- Tasks and Policy tabs refresh every 15 s when visible; usage rows update from `/api/usage`
- Host timezone was `America/Chicago` → `Europe/Berlin`; manager restart needed (glibc reads the zone once)
- Web chat, radio dot and browser terminal aligned with the Industry design; katfs share page left as is
- App follows the Industry design system: angular shapes, type scale, `IndustrySpacing`, `IndustryComponents.kt`; KatAgent 3.9
- Question from the app disappeared: sync merge replaced the conversation object `send()` held; merge fills in place, append-only; KatAgent 3.8
- Token counter per instance: `llm_usage` table, guest `POST /api/usage` attributed by source IP, admin `GET /api/usage`; openrouter only
- Guests without internet: `HOSTIF=eth0` did not exist → MASQUERADE hit nothing; `HOSTIF` used only if present, else default-route interface
- `/api/chats` long-poll (`?since=<rev>&wait=<sec>`); web hangs on it; guest lock compares path without query; KatAgent 3.7 `pollChats()`
- Rebrand: "Firecracker Manager" → kAIm56 in title, wordmark, footer, realm, User-Agent; new `logo.svg` at `/logo.svg` and `/favicon.ico`
- Every template picks its LLM: `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` for claude, `PI_MODEL`/`PRIME_MODEL` as OpenRouter selects; "other model id…" free text
- UI and API messages English throughout (code comments stay German)
- Instant trigger: a new user message pokes the orchestrator debounced (8 s); 2-h heartbeat stays as fallback
- New tool `read_inbox` (`/api/inbox`): new user messages from the shared chat store with a watermark (`?peek=1`)
- New tool `list_agents` (`/api/agents`); `orchestrator` persona and instance (gemini-2.5-flash) with a 2-h heartbeat task
- SQLite `history.db` records every executed task; tool `recall_tasks(query, limit)` via `GET /api/history`
- New tool `create_task(task, target, schedule, wait)` via `POST /api/task`: `target=<instance>` or `ephemeral`; ephemeral children may not nest

## 2026-08-13
- Signal bridge turns report to `POST /api/chat-log`; appended as `sig-<instance>-<sender>` conversations, visible in App and Web
- Limit: the claude Signal bridge is not yet connected

## 2026-08-10
- Audit log per instance: every tool call reported to `/api/audit` (tool + target, never values); `audit/<name>.jsonl` on the host, admin read
- Policy tab per instance: internet toggle, model, editable tool allowlist (`POST /api/instances/<n>/tools`), secrets, MCP, share, Activity
- Instance table shows the model in use as a chip; `/chat` sends `Cache-Control: no-store`, icons inline SVG
- pi/prime fetch missing provider keys from the broker at start (`ensure_provider_keys`); build scripts get `mkfs.ext4` PATH and atomic install
- Internet toggle per instance (`internet`, live via `apply_internet`); off = no LAN, no web, no LLM
- Tool allowlist per instance (`AGENT_TOOLS`), filtered in schema and execution; `bash` remains the master key
- Tasks tab for the existing scheduler: one-off or recurring jobs to an instance; `/api/tasks` admin-only
- Color emoji swapped for inline SVGs (tofu without an emoji font)
- Diagnosis: free gemma model talks about searching but never calls `web_search`

## 2026-08-09
- katfs cross-tenant hole (critical): node bound to `0.0.0.0:8790` without caller check; now 127.0.0.1, guests via broker `/api/katfs/*`
- Guest isolation: microVMs could route to each other; tap ACCEPTs restricted, `pool->pool` DROP
- `/api/chats` and `/api/tasks` added to the guest guard; `/api/memory/<instance>` name from source IP, not path
- API keys removed from instances: agent fetches `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` via `/api/secret/<name>` against `secret-policy.json`
- `/api/settings` and `/api/instances` guest-guarded; set secrets go out as `__unchanged__`; `settings.json` 0600
- MCP tokens removed from instances: `MCP_SERVERS=<names>` plus `/api/mcp-config` with policy-released secrets only; migration lifts old blobs
- katfs multiple shares at once (stable share-id, `GET /shares`, `?share=<id>`); `KATFS_SHARE` dropdown at creation
- `katfs-share` native provider (`iroh-fs/client/`, `--ro`, auto-reconnect); `delete` operation with three locks; share page under `/katfs/`
- Manager UI rebuilt on the Industry design system: Barlow, blueprint frames, hash-routed tabs
- Folder browser (`/api/browse`, admin-only) in mount rows; Models tab (live OpenRouter catalog → `models.json`); Sharing tab
- Rootfs rebuild atomic (mv instead of cp); `KillMode=process` in the unit (not yet installed); Docker build scripts for katfs
