"""kAIm56 — Manager (web UI + API) for 1..x microVM instances (Firecracker).

Runs as root (needs /dev/kvm, ip, iptables) under systemd. Pure standard
library. This file is the composition root and nothing else: it imports the
mgr package, wires the few cross-references the modules cannot derive
themselves, and starts the worker threads and the HTTP server. Everything
else lives in mgr/, one concern per module:

  security boundaries
    auth          admin login, lockout after failed logins, trusted Origins
    guests        a VM is identified by its source IP; what a guest may reach
    secrets       the host secret store and the per-instance release policy
    policy        tool catalog, per-instance tool gating, sandbox config
    llmproxy      the key proxy: LLM keys never enter a VM; budget/rate guard
    guestproxy    admin-to-VM relays: chat stream, terminal, katfs, /i/ proxy
    netfw         taps, anti-spoof, host input rules, egress per instance
    mounts        guest squash user, per-instance NFS exports, mount deny list
    routes_guest  every HTTP route a VM may call
    routes_admin  every HTTP route only the admin may call
  the VMs
    instances     instances/<name>.json, templates, network, running state
    vm            images, harness drive, write layer, start and stop
    tasks         task queue and worker, ephemeral VMs, orchestrator ping
    guestchat     talking to a VM's web bridge
    resources     CPU, memory and disk per instance
  HTTP
    routes        the route table (ROUTER), route helpers, body caps
    httpd         the handler class H: auth, guest gating, dispatch
    ui            the admin page (render) with ui_css / ui_html / ui_js
  data and integrations
    settings, about, models, chats, skills, personas, plugins, audit, voice,
    browse, store, memfs, hindsight, missions, rules, mcp, katfs, irohgw,
    signal, gateway, notify, saddler, websearch, extract, haalias
  small
    paths, host, util, startup

Conventions: an mgr module never imports this file. A module uses a sibling
as ``_name.func`` (module attribute, not ``from mgr.x import f``), so a test
can replace one definition in one place; the tests reach every module as
``manager._name`` — that is why every module is imported here, used or not.
