"""Routing table for the manager's HTTP handler.

Why this exists: the handler grew into a chain of ~78 sequential
``if self.path == …`` / ``startswith(…)`` branches. That chain has one nasty
property — a prefix branch standing before an exact branch silently swallows
it, and nothing tells you. It bit us twice (``/api/skills/`` vs ``/api/skills``,
and the mission routes).

Here the two kinds are kept apart: exact paths in a dict, prefixes in a list
that is always tried longest-first, and exact ALWAYS wins over prefix. With
that, the ordering in which routes happen to be registered no longer decides
who answers — shadowing cannot happen by construction.

The table is also readable from outside (:meth:`Router.inventory`), which is
what makes an "which route is not authenticated?" audit a loop instead of a
reading exercise.

Part of the mgr package: no imports from manager.py (no cycles).
